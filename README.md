The stories in this project are all created with the brief:

Write fictional stories that demonstrate an understanding of concepts
in computing.

These stories will be created for the purposes of

1. Demonstrating that the author understands computing, even
though he does not possess a degreee in computer science.

2. Helping others understand computer science.

3. Writing some very weird stories that make you go "Whoa!! This is
like some matrix level shit!"

# Generating story prompts

This repository will contain code that will provide computer related
prompts for writing stories.

# Running katas

This repository will create code for outputting markdown formatted
kata prompts.

# Contributing stories

## Submission guidelines

 * Stories must demonstrate that the author understands a concept in
computer science.

 * Stories must be well written. (I understand this is subjective. I
   will use my judgement.)

 * Stories must be interesting. (This is even more subjective. I don't
   want to feel like I am reading something I have read before.)

 * Stories must be *fictional*. This is not the place for dry
   exposition.

 * Stories must be accessible to someone who does not have a
   background in computer science.

 * Stories must be in keeping with the style of the other stories in
   the collection. I want readers to have a coherent experience.
